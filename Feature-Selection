Looking for features of player movements that help measure their healthiness.


Force (weight), angle, position, velocity accel data
- Specifically maximum velocity, average velocity
- Any difference on offense, defense, velocity and acceleration with and without ball?
Ball info if possible?
- Time since shooting, passing, or receiving the ball before injury
- Number of shots, passes, and receives
Proximity to other players
Meters traveled throughout the game until injury
Ideally, would analyze coordinate data on first game back, and see at what point data normalizes
